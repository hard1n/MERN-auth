# Authentication Project

## Description

I made this small app to practice User authentication process (register and login) in the backend, managing the data with mongoDB. Using **MERN stack**.

In this project I got my hands on:

- **Node.JS + Express** and its use for backend.
- **Mongoose** to create the data modeling.
- **bcryptJS** to encrypt passwords before storing them.
- **JsonWebToken** to generate a token when the user sing in.
- **Cookie-Parser** to generata a cookie for the session.
- **React + Vite** for the frontend.
- **Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB)** for the stylesl.
- **CORS** used as a middleware to eneble requests from frontend to backend.
- **Axios** for http requests handling.
- **Toastify** for custom popup notifications.
